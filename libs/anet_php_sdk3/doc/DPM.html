<h2 id="basic-overview">Basic Overview</h2>
<p>The Authorize.Net PHP SDK includes a class that demonstrates one way
of implementing the Direct Post Method.</p>
<p>While it is not necessary to use the AuthorizeNetDPM class to implement
DPM, it may serve as a handy reference.</p>
<p>The AuthorizeNetDPM class extends the AuthorizeNetSIM_Form class.
See the SIM.markdown for additional documentation.</p>
<h2 id="relay-response-snippet">Relay Response Snippet</h2>
<p>The AuthorizeNetDPM class contains a <code>getRelayResponseSnippet($redirect_url)</code>
which generates a snippet of HTML that will redirect a user back to your
site after submitting a checkout form using DPM/SIM.</p>
<p>Use this method(or just grab the html) if you want to create a checkout
experience where the user only interacts with pages on your site.</p>
