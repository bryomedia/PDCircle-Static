The final assessment for participants will happen on day two. Each participant will teach the lesson plan they designed to their peers and will be evaluated by an instructor using the Online Instruction Checklist.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>There is no homework for this class. Upon successful completion of BOTH Foundations Of Online Instruction classes, participants will receive an ADE certificate for 15 professional development clock hours, which equates to one (1) semester hour of coursework.<\/strong><\/p>',
